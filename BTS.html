        <pa>
            <b>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan)</b>, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.[5] The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.

After debuting in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records. They became the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first Korean act to top the US Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles to earn four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200 and US Billboard Hot 100 with their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Their follow-up releases "Savage Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter", and "Permission to Dance" made BTS the fastest act to accumulate five US number-one singles since Michael Jackson.

            Having sold over 32 million albums on the Gaon Music Chart, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the best-selling album in South Korea with Map of the Soul: 7. They are the first Asian and non-English speaking act to be named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year (2020), to chart on Billboard's Top Touring Artists of the 2010s (placing at number 45), and to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium and Rose Bowl Stadium (Love Yourself World Tour in 2019). Featured on Time's international cover as "Next Generation Leaders" and dubbed "Princes of Pop", BTS has also appeared on the magazine's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and the 100 most influential people in the world (2019). The group's numerous accolades include six American Music Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, 24 Golden Disk Awards, and nominations for two Grammy Awards and two Brit Awards. Outside of music, they partnered with UNICEF to establish the Love Myself anti-violence campaign, addressed three United Nations General Assemblies, and became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.

        <h2>MEANING OF BTS</h2>
        <pa><hr>
            The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈|少年|團), literally meaning "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets".[6][7] In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団), which translates similarly.[8] In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new brand identity.[9] This extended their name to mean "growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward."[10]

            <h4><b>Mainstream breakthrough and commercial success</b></h4>
            Shifting their sound and image from masculine hip hop to more diverse styles,[46] BTS wanted to express the beauty and anxiousness of youth and settled on the title of "花樣年華" (Korean: 화양연화; RR: Hwayangyeonhwa), loosely interpreted to define "youth" as "the most beautiful moment in life."[47] Their third EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1, explored the highs and lows of youth as well as its playful and uplifting sides.[46] The album served as an introduction to their youth trilogy, a group of albums dedicated to the struggles of youth.[10] Its lead single "I Need U" was BTS' first top five hit in South Korea and garnered the group their first ever music show win on SBS MTV's The Show.[48][49] The album's second single, "Dope (Korean: 쩔어; RR: Jjeoreo)," peaked at number three on Billboard's World Digital Songs Chart and became their first music video to receive over 100 million views on YouTube.[50][51] The group began the world tour extension of their Red Bullet Tour in June, titled 2015 Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, visiting cities throughout Asia, Oceania, North America, and Latin America.[42] Their fourth Japanese single, "For You", was released on June 17 to celebrate the first anniversary of their Japanese debut and topped Oricon's daily chart.[52]

In November, BTS commenced their third concert tour, 2015 BTS LIVE "The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: On Stage", debuting their new song and the lead single from their fourth EP The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2, "Run", during the Seoul dates.[53] Thematically, the EP focused more on the serious and speculative aspects of youth, touching on the pursuit of success, loneliness, affection for their origins, and the suffering of the younger generation due to unfavorable conditions in current society.[54] The album topped the weekly Gaon Album and Billboard World Albums charts.[55][56] It also marked their first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart.[57]

            In February 2017, BTS released the repackaged edition of Wings entitled You Never Walk Alone. Pre-orders of the repackaged broke the record for most albums sold in a month.[74][75] The repackage included its lead single "Spring Day".[76] Embodying nostalgia and sorrow, it opened a new chapter in BTS' aesthetics and lyricism and attracted many fans.[68] It entered the US Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart.[77] "Spring Day" later won Best Song of the Year at the 9th Melon Music Awards.[78] In conjunction with the release of You Never Walk Alone, BTS' second world tour, 2017 BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour, began in February and ran until December. On the tour, BTS began to play progressively larger venues, moving from halls into arenas and domes. Tickets for the North American leg sold out within minutes and two additional shows were added due to high demand, making BTS the first K-pop act to sell out arenas in the US.[79][80] After completing their North American leg, BTS attended the 24th Billboard Music Awards in May and won Top Social Artist, becoming the first Korean group awarded a Billboard Music Award.[81]

Celebrating Korean music icon Seo Taiji's 25th anniversary as a part of his anniversary project "Time: Traveler", BTS released a remake of Seo Taiji's 1995 classic "Come Back Home" in July 2017, reworking the sound and lyrics to similar sentiments toward societal change that Seo Taiji originally wrote with BTS now "maintaining its originally intensely dark feeling".[82] BTS was later invited by Seo Taiji to perform as backup vocalists and dancers for eight songs in his Seoul Olympic Stadium concert held early September.[83][84] Following the depiction of growth and temptation in Wings (2016) and consolation in You Never Walk Alone (2017), BTS embarked on their "Love Yourself" series which sought the enlightenment of self-love through the "起承轉結" (Korean: 기승전결; RR: Giseungjeongyeol) narrative sequence of "beginning, development, turn, and conclusion."[85] In September 2017, BTS released the first part of the series, their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her.[86][87] The EP was supported by two singles: the lead single "DNA" and a Steve Aoki remix of their song "Mic Drop" featuring American rapper Desiigner. The EP represented the "承," or "development" of the series and is considered by RM to be one of the major turning points in BTS' career.[88] Sonically, the EP served as "a dual exploration of the group's electro-pop and hip-hop leanings".[89]

The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming BTS' first number one album in the US, the first K-pop album to top the US albums chart, and the highest-charting album by an Asian act.[123] Love Yourself: Tear also became BTS' first top ten hit in the UK, reaching number eight on the UK Albums Chart.[124] Their single "Fake Love" became their first top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the seventeenth non-English song to reach the top ten and the first by a South Korean group.[125] At the conclusion of the Love Yourself series, BTS released their second Korean compilation album Love Yourself: Answer in August 2018,[126] which contained songs from the previous Love Yourself releases along with seven additional new tracks.[127] The album was supported by the lead single "Idol" and the alternative digital release featuring Nicki Minaj.[128][129]

Commercially, Love Yourself: Answer sold over 1.9 million copies on the Gaon Album Chart in August 2018, breaking the chart's all-time monthly record once again.[130] The album became BTS' second number-one album on the US Billboard 200 and their highest sales week in the country at that time,[131] making BTS the only K-pop act with two Billboard 200 toppers and the first pop act with two number one albums in less than a year since One Direction topped the chart with Midnight Memories in 2013 and Four in 2014.[131] Love Yourself: Answer later became the first Korean language album to be certified Gold by the RIAA in November.[99] In Canada, Love Yourself: Answer became the group's first number-one album on the Canadian Albums Chart and the single "Idol" also reached number five on the Canadian Singles Chart, marking BTS' first top-ten hit in Canada.[132] In the US, "Idol" peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.[133] Later, "Idol" and Love Yourself: Answer received platinum certifications, both selling more than 1 million certified units in the US.

In conjunction with Love Yourself: Answer's release in August 2018, BTS commenced their third world tour, BTS World Tour: Love Yourself, with a landmark concert in the Seoul Olympic Stadium, the largest stadium in South Korea.[136] During their tour, BTS also featured on Steve Aoki's single "Waste It on Me" released that October, which was their first all-English language feature.[137][138] For the final stop of the North American leg, the group performed at Citi Field in Queens, marking the first time a Korean act performed at a US stadium.[139] According to StubHub, BTS was the second best-selling concert act outside the US, behind Ed Sheeran.[140] That October, with more than a year remaining in their contract, BTS renewed their contract with Big Hit Entertainment through 2026.[141]

In early November 2018, a popular Japanese music show cancelled BTS' performance, citing a T-shirt a member wore the year before.[142] In the same month, the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) stated that BTS owed an apology for the shirt in 2017, clothing with Nazi symbolism, and a flag.[143] Big Hit Entertainment issued an apology, explaining that the images on the clothing were not intended to be hurtful to the victims of Nazism or atomic bombings and that the group and management would take steps to prevent future mistakes. They also stated the flags were meant to be a commentary on the Korean school system.[144] The apology was accepted by SWC and the Korean Atomic Bomb Victim Association.[145][146] At the 20th Mnet Asian Music Awards, BTS won their third consecutive Artist of the Year and ranked number eight on Billboard's year-end Top Artist Chart and were also the number two act of the year in the Duo/Group ranking, only behind Imagine Dragons.[147][148] They also made the Bloomberg 50 due to their "willingness to address social issues, mental health, and politics, despite being in a genre often painted as bubble gum pop".[149]
