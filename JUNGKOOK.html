The third solo, off the band's 2020 studio album Map of the Soul: 7, is a strobing R&amp;B song about forgoing teenage experiences because of his career.[18] "My Time" charted at number 84 on the US Billboard Hot 100. "Euphoria" and "My Time" are the first and second longest charting solo tracks among K-pop singers on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart, having spent 85 and 81 weeks respectively on the ranking.[19]

        <h3>Impact and influence</h3>
        <pa>
            In a 2019 survey conducted by Gallup Korea, Jungkook ranked as the third most-loved celebrity of the year in South Korea.[31] He debuted on the list in 2016 at 20th,[32] then ranked 17th in 2017,[33] and then 8th in 2018.[34] In 2018, Jungkook placed first for 10 weeks in a row for magazine Hi China, under the most beloved celebrities list in China.[35] Jungkook is also extremely popular on social media amongst fans. In December 2018, a video of him singing in the studio became the most retweeted tweet in South Korea that year.[36] Various artists have cited him as an influence and role model, such as Kim Dong-han and Hyeongseop X Euiwoong.[37] Jungkook has cited Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake and Usher among his musical inspirations.[38][39]

Jungkook's popularity has earned him the nickname "Sold Out King"[40][41] as items that he is seen using often sell out quickly. These include shoes, Downy fabric softener,[42][43] wine,[44] novels—namely I Decided to Live as Me by Kim Soo-hyun, which became a best-seller in both Korea and Japan[45]—and Hanbok. Korean media reported that Jungkook had created a "Modern Hanbok" fashion trend in the Korean entertainment industry when celebrities such as Jun Hyun-moo, Jang Do-yeon, Gong Hyo-jin, MC Oh Seung-hwan and The Return of Superman's Park Joo-ho began wearing similar clothing after he was photographed wearing it.[46]

Jungkook was 2019's most-searched male K-pop idol on Google according to their mid-year chart.[47] He topped the chart again in 2020,[48] and was the most searched K-pop idol on YouTube in 2019 and 2020. On Tumblr, he ranked 1st in 'Top K-Pop Stars' for 3 consecutive years. On Twitter, he had the most retweeted tweet of 2019,[49] and the 2nd most retweeted tweet of 2020.[50] In March 2021, Jungkook set a new all-time record for the most real-time viewers in V Live history when his solo live broadcast surpassed 22 million simultaneous viewers[51]—he first broke the record in October 2018, when his broadcast surpassed 3.7 million viewers worldwide.[52]

In June 2021, a lawmaker of the Justice Party used photos of him to promote the legalization of tattoos in South Korea, which works under regulations. The posts were widely condemned by netizens, who accused the lawmaker of taking advantage of Jungkook's fame for political purposes.[53] In the same year images of Jungkook were posted by the mayor of Tagbilaran in the Philippines, John Geesnell Yap, to convince citizens to receive the COVID shot.[54]
